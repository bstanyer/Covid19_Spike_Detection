### Analyzing Google search term data to predict Covid-19 case spikes.

This project focused on predicting spikes in Covid-19 cases by analyzing the frequency of specific Google search terms related to symptoms, bypassing the need for traditional data sources like hospital reports. By using search data as a proxy for real-world symptom reporting, the project aimed to develop a model that could anticipate surges in cases with minimal delay. The dataset included search frequencies for symptoms commonly associated with Covid-19 over the past two years, and machine learning models were trained to identify correlations between these search trends and actual case spikes.

The models successfully demonstrated that relative search term frequency alone could predict Covid-19 case spikes with notable accuracy. This approach provided a powerful, real-time alternative to traditional data collection, offering potential for early warnings and health system preparedness. The project underscores the potential of search data to serve as a predictive tool for public health trends, not only for Covid-19 but also for future outbreaks and other health-related phenomena.
